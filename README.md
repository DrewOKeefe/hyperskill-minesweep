# hyperskill-minesweep

This was an exercise on hyperskill to develope the familiar minesweeper game in Kotlin. When prompted for coordinates, enter "row column command"
Command can be either "free" or "mine". "mine" marks spot with a flag. "free" is just like clicking the square. 
Example input: 2 3 free - this selects row 2, column 3.
Example input: 2 3 mine - this places a flag on the spot.
